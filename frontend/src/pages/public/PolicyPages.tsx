        Braids by Chii_e accepts booking requests only — submitting a request does not guarantee an appointment. Every
        request is reviewed by the stylist and is either approved or declined before any appointment is confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        For online payments, your card is verified and securely saved at the time you submit a request; you are not
        charged until your request is approved. For offline payments, you arrange payment directly with the stylist,
        who confirms receipt before approving your request.

      <p>
        Payment details are handled directly by Stripe and are never stored on our servers. Booking history is kept

          Cancelling or rescheduling at least 24 hours before your appointment does not count against your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          A no-show or a cancellation made less than 24 hours before your appointment counts as a strike, and any
          deposit or payment already made is forfeited.
        </li>
        <li>
          After a second strike, future bookings require full payment upfront before your request can be submitted.

        <li>Arriving within 15 minutes of your appointment time is not treated as a no-show.</li>
        <li>
          Refunds are only issued when the stylist needs to cancel or reschedule your appointment — never for
          client-initiated cancellations.
